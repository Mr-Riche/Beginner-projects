 Python Beginner Projects

Welcome to my Python learning journey! 👋

This repository contains my beginner-level Python projects, exercises, and coding challenges as I learn the fundamentals of programming. I'm currently exploring:

- 🧠 Primitive types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
- 🔁 Control flow (if/else, loops)
- 🔧 Functions (basics, parameters, return values)
- 📂 More coming soon...

Each file or folder in this repo is a step forward in my practice. The goal is to build a solid foundation in Python and improve problem-solving skills by writing clean and simple code.

📌 Why this repo?

- To track my progress
- To keep a portfolio of what I've learned
- To practice using Git and GitHub
- To receive feedback from others in the community

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or try out some of the challenges yourself!

/// 🚀 What's Next?

As I learn more topics like data structures, object-oriented programming, and modules, I’ll keep updating this repository with new projects and improvements.
